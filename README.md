# WE THREE HEADS

This game was created in under 48 hours for [Miz Jam 1](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1) using [these assets](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack).

You face off against three difficult bosses as you uncover the difficult truth about yourself and the evil these seals are guarding. Each boss will present a unique challenge, and on the highest difficulty the game is almost impossible if one approaches the heads casually. Hopefully this game is fun to play and helpful for others as they check out the code!
